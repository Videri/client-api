  <p>
    Provided is the Vistar Media client API. It's assumed from here on out that
    you have an active account on Vistar Media's system which will provide you
    with a network identifier and an API key.

  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>
    The provided API allowes a network to serve real time ads on their devices
    and submit the necessary proofs of play after the fact. It is meant to
    integrate into a Java CMS, Scheduler, or player.
  </p>

  <h2>Project Integration</h2>
  
  <p>
    Depending on your project's layout, there are a number of ways to
    integration Vistar Media's API. A few are outlined below.
  </p>

  <h4>Maven Integraiton</h4>

  <p>
    As there are quite the grab bag of HTTP clients available on the JVM, there
    are a number of implementations provided, each scoped {@code provided}. You
    must choose the HTTP client below you'd like to use and not only follow the
    specified configuration, but ensure that it's available in your build (the
    dependency will not be specified here).
  </p>


  <pre class="prettyprint">&lt;dependencies&gt;
  &lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.vistarmedia&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;api&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.1-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;/dependencies&gt;</pre>

  <h5>Async HTTP Client</h5>

  <p>
    The Reccomended HTTP client to use is <a
    href="https://github.com/sonatype/async-http-client">async-http-client</a>.
    This will allow for bulk requests to be made in parallel. The downside is
    that it pulls in potentially conflicting dependencies (such at Netty).
  </p>

  <p>
    To use async-http-client, add the following to your project's {@code
    pom.xml}:
  </p>

  <pre class="prettyprint">&lt;dependencies&gt;
  &lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.ning&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;async-http-client&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.6.5&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;/dependencies&gt;</pre>
